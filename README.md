# Card Game
## About
This card game is a JAVA based card game implementing basic GUI properties.
## Instructions
The game functions by shuffling a stack of cards and dealing them. The player first places his/her bet and then decide if they want to draw another card to replace any of their cards.

At most they can replace two cards.

Then the player presses the *Results* button which allows they to see the results of the game. If the player has a better hand than the dealer then the player wins otherwise the dealer wins. Each player starts with 100$.
## Usage
Place the `src/` Folder and the `Images/` folder in the working directory and run the file `Main.java`.

### Alternative method
Compile all the java files and run using the command interface.

You can use the code.
```bash
javac ./src/*.java
mv ./src/*.class ./bin/
java ./bin/Main.class
```
